web Scraping

# What is Web Scraping??:
 Suppose you want some information from a website? Let’s say a paragraph on Donald Trump! What do you do? Well, you can copy and paste the information from Wikipedia to your own file. But what if you want to get large amounts of information from a website as quickly as possible? Such as large amounts of data from a website to train a Machine Learning algorithm? In such a situation, copying and pasting will not work! And that’s when you’ll need to use Web Scraping


===================================================================================
## How use it? :

```
 first: copy your webpage link
```

```
second: inspect the page and select the class from the object you want to get information.
```

```
 third: choose your keyword and use it
```
```
 fourth: And there we go!
```

```
fifth: And there we go!
```
